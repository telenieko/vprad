Very Pythonic Rapid Application Development
===========================================

This Django package allows you to rapidly build applications with minimal
effort on the frontend side.

It is mainly targeted at Line-Of-Bussiness applications, backend, etc.

It borrows ideas from Lino, Apache Isis, Cuba Platform and some others.

**Documentation is forthcoming.**

In the meantime you might take a look at the demo_project folder:
