This template is blank on purpose, it is meant for you to override in order
to decide which layout you want to extend from.

So, in a normal case, your project would have a fomanticui/base.html template
extending from a base layout, then all fomanticui base templates will work
from that layout (as all of them extend fomanticui/base.html) as is the case
with simple_list or simple_form.
